"Did you know the famous Coach Gabe Orn, former head of the Sausage Slammers and the Enlightened Gentelmen, has quit BloodBowl all together? Despite his success, he decided to focus on escaping the cycle of samsara and hasnâ€™t been seen since."
"Kel the Honored One, the star saurus player of the Underated Uppercuts, was favored to win Savage Scrimmage Series player of the year, having won three other trophies. This was upset when league owner Trorc DiLorco rigged the competition in order to win thousands of crowns betting on Plato of the Enlightened Gentelmen. Many who bet on Kel have not financially recovered to this day."
"Sir Blitz Bowl, coach of Seagram's Seargants in season one, performed so poorly that he was tortured and mutated into a chaos spawn for the season two team Baerwyn's Breakers. Still, some insist that ""Sir Blister Bowl"" isn't actually Sir Blitz Bowl at all, and in reality he went into hiding in Lustria."
"Did you know the record for player with the fastest consecutive deaths is held by J.K. Rowling? Starting her career on the East India Stabbing Company, she was slaughtered by Baerwyn's Breakers, who accepted her into their pack with Nurgle's grace. Instead of getting a second chance, she was immediately killed in the next match by Literally Underworld."
"A number of teams have been entering the league through portals to a realm called ""Ryall Wyrld,"" and are initially confused by their transformation into non-human creatures. A notable exception to this is Thorin Co., who aren't native to this world but instead claim to be from Middle Earth."
"Did you know the record for highest scoring match is from the very first season of the Savage Scrimmage Series! In the quarterfinals of playoffs, Seagram's Seargants and the Philadelphia Plea Deals managed to score a cumulative seven touchdowns before the whistle blew, with the Plea Deals making it just barely out ahead. No other match so far has come close to this incredible score."
"Due to the massive success of the league, entry is highly restricted. As a result many lesser coaches are forced to join the ladder, a more casual format that is poorly televised and demands little viewership. There they hope to amass enough of a following to gain a spot in the next real season."
"The Ship's Crew was a team of halfling prison inmates from the first season. After winning the Loser Bowl, they had their treemen throw them out of the stadium where they made a break for freedom. If anyone has any information on the whereabouts of any of their former members, please alert the local authorities."
"Emperor John Madden was elected to the highest office in the Empire on his pro-BloodBowl policies, such as ""BloodBowl for All"" which mandates players in prison be given parole to attend matches, and ""We Didn't See Nuthin',"" which makes televised BloodBowl recordings inadmissable in court."
"There is a 1 in 1,000,000 chance that when the lore tidbit loads it's replaced by a picture of Troy's cock and balls instead."
"After being rejected from joining Hellgorger's Howlers, Walner Snout orchestrated Abby's kidnapping, but was caught and imprisoned. Despite this he managed to coach a team of his own, the Snoutstars, which lost in the quarterfinals of season two to the East India Stabbing Company. He escaped prison, upon which he killed a fourteen year-old girl to steal her orb so he could publicly declare his vengeance on the British. Experts name him the 37th most violent BloodBowl player."
"The Furry Pole Polisher, or F.P.P., managed to be the most resolute goblin on the Enlightened Gentlemen, often remaining the last player on the pitch despite his shattered bones. This earned him the VSPN Most Heart Award: a pogo stick. Not content to retire, he would use that same pogo stick to become the top scorer of Coach M.O.M.'s next team, the Alimony Payments."
Underworld troll Le Doge of the Enlightened Gentlemen is widely believed to be responsible for the attack on the Couronne spires.

Did you know that BloodBowl 2 has a single server that generates all the random rolls for all players worldwide? Wise coaches make use of this by hiring Chinese dice farms to get all the 1s out of the way before they make that field-wide long bomb into the end zone.
"Officially, the Schmeat Smashers were torn to shreds by wolves after losing the season one Loser Bowl. Behind closed curtains, whispers abound that they were sacrificed to Sotek in exchange for future lizard teams to have bountiful luck."
"The season three Creatively Bankrupt Team is full of members ""inspired"" by previous stars. Coach Temu spends 80% of the team's earnings on fighting copyright infringement lawsuits."
"An annual family reunion gathers a wide assortment of unusual characters, such as Troy DiLillo, Trorc DiLorco, Tralala DiHalflillo, and more. None of them are quite sure how they're related, but none ever turn down the invitation. None except for T. MacDaddylillo, who lost his spot due to his abysmal coaching of the Final Fentasy during season three."
"Coach M.O.M. and Manager D.A.D. rule the underworld, occasionally creeping to the surface to coach a BloodBowl team from the shadows. No one really knows who, or even what, they really are."
"When Hellgorger's Howlers disbanded at the end of season one, Ankhes Suneater took her earnings to start an party rental company, Ankhes's Entertainment and Rentals. Emboldened by the business's moderate success, she came out of retirement to coach a Norse team for season three. "
"After teaching the Race Traitors the true meaning of being a dwarf, Doctor Defense turned his attention to upholding the honor of the Savage Scrimmage Series. He formed the League of BloodBowl Protectors, bringing together an elite group of ex-BloodBowl players for one purpose: killing people at the slightest provocation."
"There have been a number of channels to watch Savage Scrimmage Series commentary on throughout the years. The Violence and Scandal Programming Network (VSPN), Imperial French and Brettonian Sports Network (IFaBSN), and CTESPN (which doesn't stand for anything) on CabalVision, plus the Underrated Uppercuts and MrBeast channels on GhoulTube. In season four VSPN decided to move to streaming on Snitch in order to save on production costs."
Never In Doubt of the Snoutstars spent the second season encouraging BloodBowl players everywhere to take pride in the game and play fair. Did he find practically no success? It was never in doubt!
"Fun fact: apothecaries are actually worthless. Less than worthless, in fact, because they waste 50,000 TV. Regen is also a fake skill that doesn't do anything."
Sean Mannix is universally reviled. He doesn't deserve coach of the year.
"Minotaurs are notoriously strong-willed, and ""Grazing"" Daisy exemplified that by spending half her time on the pitch on all fours eating tufts of grass that grew from the astrogranite. Even moreso, she rejected Hellgorger's harem to live a monogamous life with her husband, the Black Book. He was one of the few survivors of the Schmeat Smashers, due to being fired halfway through the season for a career-ending injury to the collarbone."
"Ball Boy of the Sausage Slammers managed to win season one's MVP award. Despite only being third most experienced and the second best scoring, losing to Bobby Bipolar of the Avenue Assailants on both counts, Ball Boy was beloved by the fans and won the popularity vote."
"Sir Blister Bowl is memorialized not only for being allegedly being a decoy for the real Sir Blitz Bowl, but also for being one of the worst players to ever stop foot on the BloodBowl pitch. He spent much of his matches idling stupidly as the game unfolded around him, and on average only made two blocks per half."
"Savage Scrimmage Series funding is handled by goblin financier Grimblo Greednuts. Many accuse him of being greedy, shortsighted, and easily bribed, but he's also embezzling funds into an offshore account in Albion."
"When Knitt Pik was fired from VSPN so that Aftercare with Abby could move in a more ""halfling"" direction, he ended up finding work as a defensive coach for the Underated Uppercutsss, leading them to their position in the season two final. Unfortunately, not even his wealth of knowledge was able to stop an elf team from scoring."
"Before moving to Snitch, VSPN was known for hosting the popular Aftercare with Abby program, where Abby Applebottom would interview players fresh off the pitch and Knitt Pik would review sports replays and offer commentary."
"After season one ended with Abby's life being under threat no less than three times, she took a sabbatical to recover with her family in the Moot. During that time her segment was rebranded to Aftercare with the Applebottoms, with her cousins Jeanette and Jeanine taking over Abby's role as host and Jeanine's boyfriend Boots Whiffithur replacing Knitt as replay commentator."
"The Schnozz Detectives are a group of skaven radicals with the goal of bringing the underworld to self-governance. They made headlines when they shot up the VSPN offices, hospitalizing many of the hosts. They would later team up with Walner Snout to kidnap Abby in an attempt to gain leverage, but she was rescued by a number of brave players who aided in their arrest. "
"The winner of the first season of the Savage Scrimmage Series was the Philadelphia Plea Deals, a skaven team coached by Horus (Sean). They ended their winning season with a TV of 1190."
"The winner of the second season of the Savage Scrimmage Series was the dark elf team East India Stabbing Company, coached by the Queen (Sean). They ended their winning season with a TV of 1640."
"The loser of the Loser Bowl in the first season of the Savage Scrimmage Series was the Schmeat Smashers, a lizardmen team coached by Coach Skillzard (Jackie). They ended their losing season with a TV of 1240."
"The loser of the Loser Bowl in the second season of the Savage Scrimmage Series was the Underworld Denizens, an underworld team coached by Charon (Aidan). They ended their losing season with a TV of 1130."
"Did you know that the original mascot of the Savage Scrimmage Series is actually a character taken from a different streamer's BloodBowl 1 league? WoWcrendor and their star player Lil' Skittles the skink was one of the inspirations for starting a BloodBowl league in the first place, but once the SSS went public on Snitch we had to downplay the use of Lil' Skittles for obvious reasons."
"Did you know that in actual BloodBowl lore there are a number of star players from all races that use secret weapons, such as the human Helmut Wolf with his chainsaw and Boomer the dwarf bombardier. BloodBowl 2 greenwashed them, making all secret weapon star players into goblins."
"Did you know that BloodBowl 3 doesn't exist? It just doesn't, and any differing information you might find is made up to gaslight you."
"While plenty of blood is spilled on the pitch, BloodBowl fans can be just as violent. One of the greatest death tolls is attributed to the feud between Nobbla fans and Nobbla haters, a disagreement than began as an argument on Twerper but has grown into an all-out war."
"Casual fans refer to the season three team Final Fentasy as a chaos dwarf team, but attentive fans will know that it's actually a team of humans, hobhumans (short for hobo humans), and humans riding horses. Oh and also a minotaur."
"While BloodBowl is by no means an honorable sport, there is one golden rule that no Savage Scrimmage Series coach would ever dare break: to never concede before a match is over. At least not after seeing what happened to Coach Ryan Reynolds, who conceded his match against the Greenbay Badgers and was consequently subjected to torture that would make a Slaaneshi cultist blush."
"Did you know that the most deaths in a single game is three? In the season three match between the Green Bay Badgers and Beast Games, the latter had three players die before the final whistle blew. This also grants them the record for most deaths on the same team in a single game."
"Most players don't know what the big forks at either end of the pitch are for, but they're actually used for tie-breakers! In the case that a game goes into overtime and the tie isn't broken, each team lines up taking turns to kick in between the poles, with the first team to fail losing. This has only happened once in the history of the SSS, in the quarterfinals match of season two between Baerwyn's Breakers and New Reikland Patriots."
"Ankhes's Entertainment and Rentals became the first team in the league to send every opponenet off the field, and against lizardmen no less. The Mascot Horrors got field wiped, but a large part of the glory belongs to the journeyman Finn Gunnbjorn, who perfomed three fouls in a row that all resulted in KOs or injuries without getting caught. Coach Suneater would later comment that journeymen often outperformed her actual players, likely because they're hoping to get hired."
"Did you know that there's nothing in the rulebook against riding a pogo stick? So far the only pogoer players to have made it into the league have been goblins, largely due to cultural stereotyping, but the Pogres, a full team of ogres on pogo sticks, have been attending tryouts every year since the league's inception."
"Some coaches firmly believe that nothing ever happens, and react violently when presented with evidence of things happening. This phenomenon is known as ""cope."""
"The FreakBowl is a niche non-televised event run by season one beastman player Calamity Janet. After Hellgorger's Howlers quit BloodBowl, she became the league commissioner for FreakBowl, a sport that has nothing to do with BloodBowl and in fact is too vile to explain here."
